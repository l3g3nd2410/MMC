## Description :

This mod was created to change map ingame to a modded one by creating a vote for it

## Features :
- The mod will display in the list the modded maps that the user has downloaded (mod.io and steam workshop)
- Choose a modded map / create a vote to change map
	
## NOTE :

- You must be in a mp room to create a vote, but you can refresh the list from the garage
- If you launch the game and the map list is empty, simply refresh the list as the maps take some time to be loaded by the game
- If you install a map from mod.io or steam workshop, just refresh the list and it will be added to the mod
